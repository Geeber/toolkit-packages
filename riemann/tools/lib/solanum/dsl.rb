# This file defines some helper methods for Solanum's monitoring DSL.


##### SOURCE DEFINITIONS #####

# A list of all registered metrics sources.
$sources = []


# Registers a new source object. If a block is given, it is used to configure
# the source with instance_exec.
def register_source(source, config=nil)
  source.instance_exec &config if config
  $sources << source
  source
end


# Registers a source which runs a command and matches against output lines.
def run(command, &config)
  register_source Solanum::Source::Command.new(command), config
end


# Registers a source which matches against the lines in a file.
def read(path, &config)
  register_source Solanum::Source::File.new(path), config
end


# Registers a source which computes metrics directly.
def compute(&block)
  register_source Solanum::Source::Compute.new(block)
end



##### HELPER METHODS #####

# Creates a state function based on thresholds. If the first argument is a
# symbol, it is taken as the default service state. Otherwise, arguments should
# be alternating numeric thresholds and state values to assign if the metric
# value exceeds the threshold.
#
# For example, for an 'availability' metric you often want to warn on low
# values. To assign a 'critical' state to values between 0% and 10%,
# 'warning' between 10% and 25%, and 'ok' above, use the following:
#
#     thresholds(0.00, :critical, 0.10, :warning, 0.25, :ok)
#
# For 'usage' metrics it's the inverse, giving low values ok states and
# warning about high values:
#
#     thresholds(:ok, 55, :warning, 65, :critical)
#
def thresholds(*args)
  default_state = nil
  default_state = args.shift unless args.first.kind_of? Numeric

  # Check arguments.
  raise "Thresholds must be paired with state values" unless args.count.even?
  args.each_slice(2) do |threshold|
    limit, state = *threshold
    raise "Limits must be numeric: #{limit}" unless limit.kind_of? Numeric
    raise "State values must be strings or symbols: #{state}" unless state.instance_of?(String) || state.instance_of?(Symbol)
  end

  # State block.
  lambda do |v|
    state = default_state
    args.each_slice(2) do |threshold|
      if threshold[0] < v
        state = threshold[1]
      else
        break
      end
    end
    state
  end
end
